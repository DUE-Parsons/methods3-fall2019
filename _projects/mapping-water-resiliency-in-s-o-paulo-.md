A severe drought hit the city of S達o Paulo in the summer of 2014 and 2015 and water provision to the 9 million residents serviced by the Cantareira reservoir system was adversely affected. I will examine social, spatial and environmental inequalities in a post-disaster urban setting by revisiting the communities hit by the S達o Paulo water accessibility crisis of 2015. By comparing the physical and social infrastructure of these communities in 2015 and in 2019, I will learn about their resiliency efforts and their distribution patterns throughout the city.

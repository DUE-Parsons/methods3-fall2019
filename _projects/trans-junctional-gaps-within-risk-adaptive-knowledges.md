Within this project I am mapping capacity building gaps that exist within the regional-scape of the Caribbean specific to Barbuda. Though this research initially catalyzed from my on-going work in wanting to craft transnational coalitions between Red Hook and Barbuda; this particular mapping will highlight the trans-regional and localized gaps that exist within the Caribbean specific to Barbuda. To be clear, I am looking at what happens to regional capacity building synergy and risk adaptive knowledge as they moves across the Caribbean prior to reaching transnational coalition building. In this particular work, I call such gaps in collaborative synergy, communication and capacity building, trans-junctional fissures. At these fissure points are where communicative support and trauma informed synergies are needed the most. So far, my research is illuminating that these junction points are either existing unassisted and/or do not exist at all. Without their existence, Black “disaster-prone” communities are perpetually trapped to systemized cycle of “dependency” and socio-spatial vulnerabilities that with “naturalizing” disaster.
